    This site is a showcase of custom components built on Angular v21, fully guided by Atomic Design
    principles. From Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms to reusable page compositions, it demonstrates
    a consistent, scalable, and maintainable component system. You can explore each component’s
    interaction behavior, styling conventions, and real-world usage scenarios to help teams deliver
    high-quality interfaces faster while maintaining readability, testability, performance, and
    long-term maintainability.
